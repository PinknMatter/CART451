                <h3>Self - Bio</h3>
                <p>
                    It's always been a struggle for me,
to write a biography about myself, you see.
How can a few sentences capture
the complexities of my nature?
I'm not sure what to say,
mostly because I don't like writing about me.
Sometimes it feels like boasting
or I can't do myself justice, you'll agree.
I can describe who I am right now,
but the future is a mystery.
I'm still discovering who I want to be,
and what my life's true purpose will be.
