                <h3>Self - Bio</h3>
                <p>
                    It's always been a struggle for me,
                    to write a biography about myself, you see.
                    How can a few sentences capture
                    the complexities of my nature?
                    I'm not sure what to say,
                    mostly because I don't like writing about me.
                    Sometimes it feels like boasting
                    or I can't do myself justice, you'll agree.
                    I can describe who I am right now,
                    but the future is a mystery.
                    I'm still discovering who I want to be,
                    and what my life's true purpose will be.

                <h3>CrowdSourcing</h3>
                <p>
                    "The Sheep Market" by Aaron Koblin and Lauren McCarthy's "Social Turkers" project both exemplify 
                    the principles of crowdsourcing discussed by Jeff Howe and Lauren Lee Mccarthy. Koblin's project, centered around crowdsourced 
                    art (specifically, drawings of sheep), mirrors Howe's notion of distributing traditionally individual tasks
                    to a diverse crowd for collective creativity. Similarly, "Social Turkers" explores the diversity of human 
                    interactions in a digital context, showcasing the collaborative potential of technology-mediated social tasks.
                    These projects underscore the power of crowdsourcing to engage individuals from various backgrounds in creative 
                    and collaborative endeavors, while also challenging conventional boundaries between work, art, and social
                    interaction in the digital age.
